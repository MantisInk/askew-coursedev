# **Gameplay Prototype**

## Objective
Playing as ~~"dude" from Lab 4 (now with giant arm enhancements!)~~ definitely not Tangrowth from Pok√©mon, you must swing from vine to vine to reach the goal!


## Controls (_Requires Xbox Controller_)

### Grabbing
_Used to take hold of vines and other parts of the stage!_

- _**Left bumper (LB)**_: grab (_holding the bumper_) or release (_letting go of the bumper_) an object with **left** hand
- _**Right bumper (LB)**_: grab (_holding the bumper_) or release (_letting go of the bumper_) an object with **right** hand

#### Rules for Grabbing

For the purpose of this prototype, you are only able to grab the vines (any part of them) and the center of the victory panel.


### Swinging
_Used to gain momentum on vines to swing yourself across the stage!_

- _**Left joystick**_: swing **white** arm in whichever diretion you tilt
- _**Right joystick**_: swing **black** arm in whichever diretion you tilt

_**Note:** 360 degrees of motion is possible here_

_NEW: You can now swing your arms at all times!_

#### _Tips for Swinging (This is NEW Though)_

Swinging works a little differently this time around compared to the gameplay prototype. There is a steep learning curve, but once you get a hang of the controls, the physics actualy work out very well.

- **Use your free arm to swing.** As before, using your heavy arm to bulid momentum will help you swing higher on the vine. Think of swinging on a swing and how you move your legs to gain altitude. As you start to swing in the direction you are trying to travel, slowly move the control stick for your free arm from its original position to the direction you are trying to go, keeping the stick on the edges of the controller like moving in a half-circle instead of immediately going from point A to point B. Until you get a feel for the movement, I don't recommend doing jerky movements.
- **Let go of the joystick if you confuse the arms** When you're confused about which arm is which, or you just don't know which way to position your arms, letting go of the joystick while still grabbing will help you reorient yourself.
- **Use your non-free arm to help swing.** While you swing your free arm in the direction you're trying to move, you'll actually want to _**move your non-free arm in the exact opposite direction as your swinging arm.**_ This will help you gain the maximum height and speed in order to launch yourself to where you need to go
- **Jump!** If you get stuck on the ground, try swinging your arms in opposite directions to the direction you want to go. The more your arms rotate, the further you jump. One of our emergent behaviors from swinging is that this motion will cause you to fly off the ground slightly, which should be enough height to get you level with a grabbable object.
- **Alternate your movement.** If none of the above tips work for you, here is my strategy: throughout the whole game keep each arm in opposite directions (never go back to neutral position). From here, always move in half-circle rotations, having the arm you want to swing lead in a particular direction and the non-free arm always rotating in the opposite direction. For example, if your right stick rotates in a "bottom half-circle" have your left stick move in a "top half-circle." As always make sure each stick is pointing in the exact opposite direction of the other. Whenever you want to go in one direction, the other stick must move as well.

### Misc.
- _**Right button**_: turns on debug mode 
- _**Any other button**_: resets the game

~~_**Note:** force vector on each hand will appear once you start moving its respective arm. The left hand is designated by the blue vector, and the right hand is designated by the red vector._~~ _NEW: We took out the force vectors since we didn't need them anymore. We also heard from playtesters that this helped them play better._


## ~~Tip for Leaving the Starting Platform~~ No More Starting Platform!
_NEW: You now press the right bumper button to start the level, causing you to start to fall onto a vine that you are able to grab._

## Hints for Completing the Stage

- **You can grab any point on the vine.** If you find yourself being just short of reaching the vine or traveling to the vine too slowly, try swinging and launching yourself from a different height on the vine!
- **Your player is actually very mobile.** With 360 degrees of movement, your character is able to swing himself around when grabbing an object. This is particularly useful for climbing up vines or for swinging yourself around to a different side of the vine!
- _**NEW: Utilize momentum.** Your arms are quite heavy. If you find yourself stuck hanging off of a branch, try to fling your free arm over to swing over the branch!_

## Known Issue

The movement of the character this time around is very difficult with a steep learning curve. We are aware that the given control scheme to move the character isn't very intuitive for many players. Due to a miscommunication and people's schedules, this was not fixed in time for the Technical Prototype submission. This will be the first thing to be fixed for the Alpha Prototype.


## Proof of Concept

See a video of us completing the stage [here!](https://youtu.be/2al6WDgCgpQ)

## Maximizing Fun

If you reach the goal, you can actually grab its center point and swing around on it! Since we don't have a sequence for completing the stage, you can swing around it as much as you want! Yay! Congrats for reaching the victory spot!


## Hard Mode

- Try to get from the victory point back to the start! _(This isn't very hard anymore though.)_
- For the last vine of the stage (the one right before the victory panel), you can actually swing and land on the peak of the ramp above! See if you can too!
- One of our play testers got through the majority of the stage by only using the helicopter arm swinging movement. See if you can try going through the whole level while doing that!
- Henry managed to get through the entire level only using the right arm. See if you can too!
