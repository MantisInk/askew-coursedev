# **Gameplay Prototype**

## Objective
Playing as ~~"dude" from Lab 4 (now with giant arm enhancements!)~~ definitely not Tangrowth from Pok√©mon, you must swing from vine to vine to reach the goal!


## Controls (_Requires Xbox Controller_)

### Grabbing
_Used to take hold of vines and other parts of the stage!_

- _**Left bumper (LB)**_: grab (_holding the bumper_) or release (_letting go of the bumper_) an object with **left** hand
- _**Right bumper (LB)**_: grab (_holding the bumper_) or release (_letting go of the bumper_) an object with **right** hand

#### Rules for Grabbing

For the purpose of this prototype, you are only able to grab the vines (any part of them) and the center of the victory panel ~~and certain sections of the upper floor~~. _No walls or ceilings are grabbable at this time._


### Swinging
_Used to gain momentum on vines to swing yourself across the stage!_

- _**Left joystick**_: swing **left** arm in whichever diretion you tilt
- _**Right joystick**_: swing **right** arm in whichever diretion you tilt

_**Note:** 360 degrees of motion are possible here_

#### ~~Rules for Swinging~~ Not Anymore!

~~Due to a technical issue, there is a specific rule for swinging your arms: _you must be "grabbing" in order to move and arm_ (whether your character is actually grabbing an object/vine or not). **This rule is true at all times.**~~ _NEW: You can now swing your arms at all times! You can even "helicopter" them to fly slightly off the ground!_

#### __Tips for Swinging(This is NEW Though)__

Swinging works a little differently this time around compared to the gameplay prototype. There is a steep learning curve, but once you get a hang of the controls, the physics actualy work out very well.

- **Use your free arm to swing.** As before, using your heavy arm to bulid momentum will help you swing higher on the vine. Think of swinging on a swing and how you move your legs to gain altitude. As you start to swing in the direction you are trying to travel, slowly move the control stick for your free arm from its original position to the direction you are trying to go, keeping the stick on the edges of the controller like moving in a half-circle instead of immediately going from point A to point B. Until you get a feel for the movement, I don't recommend doing jerky movements.
- **Use your non-free arm to help swing.** While you swing your free arm in the direction you're trying to move, you'll actually want to __**move your non-free arm in the exact opposite direction as your swinging arm.**__ This will help you gain the maximum height and speed in order to launch yourself to where you need to go
- **Helicopter!** If you get stuck on the ground, try swinging your arms around in full circular motions. One of our emergent behaviors from swinging is that this motion will cause you to fly off the ground slightly, which should be enough height to get you level with a grabbable object.
- **Alternate your movement.** If none of the above tips work for you, here is my strategy: throughout the whole game keep each arm in opposite directions (never go back to neutral position). From here, always move in half-circle rotations, having the arm you want to swing lead in a particular direction and the non-free arm always rotating in the opposite direction. For example, if your right stick rotates in a "bottom half-circle" have your left stick move in a "top half-circle." As always make sure each stick is pointing in the exact opposite direction of the other. Whenever you want to go in one direction, the other stick must move as well.

### Misc.
- _**Start button**_: resets the game 
- _**Any other button**_: nothing

~~_**Note:** force vector on each hand will appear once you start moving its respective arm. The left hand is designated by the blue vector, and the right hand is designated by the red vector._~~ _NEW: We took out the force vectors since we didn't need them anymore. We also heard from playtesters that this helped them play better._


## ~~Tip for Leaving the Starting Platform~~ No More Starting Platform!
__NEW: You now press the right bumper button to start the level, causing you to start to fall onto a vine that you are able to grab.__
~~If the rule for swinging didn't make sense, following these instructions may help you understand what's going on (and be able to leave the starting platform as a result). Once you get going, the rule will make sense and hopefully you'll find that it only causes trouble for gameplay at this particular spot.~~

~~1. Tilt both arms to the bottom left corner of the screen~~
~~2. Hold down the grab button for either hand (I find myself using the right bumper)~~
~~3. With the _**opposite arm**_ (the one you're not grabbing with), reach for the first vine and try to grab it (I find myself using the left joystick and left bumper for this)~~
~~4. If you grabbed it, use the other arm to start swinging on the vine!~~

~~- I recommend waiting until the vine has swung to the left of its swinging cycle two times, it's a bit easier to grab after that point. ~~
~~- It may take a few tries to get used to this and not keep falling off the platform. If this happens, you should be able to press _**Start**_ to restart the stage (_see Known Issues_). ~~


## Hints for Completing the Stage

- **You can grab any point on the vine.** If you find yourself being just short of reaching the vine or traveling to the vine too slowly, try swinging and launching yourself from a different height on the vine!
- **Your player is actually very mobile.** With 360 degrees of movement, your character is able to swing himself around when grabbing an object. This is particularly useful for climbing up vines or for swinging yourself around to a different side of the vine!
- __**NEW: Utilize momentum.** Your arms are quite heavy. If you find yourself stuck hanging off of a branch, try to fling your free arm over to swing over the branch!__

## Known Issue

The movement of the character this time around is very difficult with a steep learning curve. We are aware that the given control scheme to move the character isn't very intuitive for many players. Due to a miscommunication and people's schedules, this was not fixed in time for the Technical Prototype submission. This will be the first thing to be fixed for the Alpha Prototype.


## Proof of Concept

See a video of us completing the stage [here!](https://youtu.be/2al6WDgCgpQ)

## Maximizing Fun

If you reach the goal, you can actually grab its center point and swing around on it! Since we don't have a sequence for completing the stage, you can swing around it as much as you want! Yay! Congrats for reaching the victory spot!


## Hard Mode

- Try to get from the victory point back to the start! __(This isn't very hard anymore though.)__
- For the last vine of the stage (the one right before the victory panel), you can actually swing and land on the peak of the ramp above! See if you can too!
- One of our play testers got through the majority of the stage by only using the helicopter arm swinging movement. See if you can try going through the whole level while doing that!
